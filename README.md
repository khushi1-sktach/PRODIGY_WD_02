ðŸ•’ Stopwatch Web App â€” Project Description

The Stopwatch Web App is a simple yet elegant time-tracking application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Designed with a vibrant purple gradient theme, this stopwatch provides essential functionalities like Start, Pause, Reset, and Lap trackingâ€”all within a user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing interface.

The app features a bold digital display to show elapsed time in HH:MM:SS format, along with interactive buttons that respond with smooth transitions. Users can easily log lap times, which appear below the stopwatch in a clean, styled list. The layout is fully responsive and centered, making it perfect for both desktop and mobile use.

This project was created to strengthen skills in DOM manipulation, event handling, and time-based functions like setInterval in JavaScript, while also experimenting with modern UI design using CSS gradients, shadows, and transitions.
